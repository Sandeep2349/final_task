        One of the most prominent features of Sankrati is the flying of kites. People of all ages participate in kite-flying competitions, filling the skies with colorful kites. The act of flying kites symbolizes freedom and joy, and it is believed to bring good luck and positive energy.

    <p>
        Another important aspect of Sankrati is the preparation and consumption of traditional sweets made from sesame seeds (til) and jaggery (gur). These sweets are considered auspicious and are exchanged among friends and family as a gesture of goodwill. The combination of sesame seeds and jaggery is believed to provide warmth and energy during the winter season.

        In addition to kite flying and sweet preparations, people take holy dips in rivers, especially in the Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery rivers. It is believed that taking a dip in these sacred rivers during Sankrati cleanses one's sins and brings spiritual purification.

        Overall, Sankrati is a vibrant festival that brings communities together to celebrate nature's bounty, express gratitude, and welcome new beginnings with hope and positivity.
